## Environment Variables

To start the service locally, you need to export the current environment variables:

    export CONTRACTUS_POSTGRES_URL=<>

But, to play around the code and tests, it's possible with the command line ‚§µÔ∏è‚§µÔ∏è‚§µÔ∏è

## Command line
All commands are synthesized in the Makefile, to start the development environment, just run:

    make dev/start
    make dev <- You will be able to run commands inside the container

After run `make dev`, it's possible to run the following commands inside the container:
    
- The integration tests: `make integration-test testcase=<>`
- The Unit tests: `make test testcase=<>`
- The lint: `make lint`

Or, it's also possible run from local:

- make `dev/integration-test testcase=<>`
- make `dev/test testcase=<>`

The testcase variable could be used to run a specific test
